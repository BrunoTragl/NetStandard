# Netstandard Guide

## Who is this for?

1. [I already have a PCL csproj and I want to move to netstandard.](https://github.com/davidfowl/NetStandard/blob/master/PclToNetStandard.md)
2. I'm starting from my .NET Framework csproj and I want to go to netstandard.
3. I'm starting from scratch and I want to support netstandard OR I'm willing to change my current project system and build to use the new xproj project system.
